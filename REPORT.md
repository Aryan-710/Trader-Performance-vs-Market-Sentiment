## Methodology

The analysis combines transaction-level trading data with daily market sentiment data.

1. Trade timestamps were normalized to a daily level to align with sentiment data.
2. Trades were aggregated at the trader–day and day levels to compute meaningful metrics.
3. Performance metrics such as daily profit/loss and win rate were calculated.
4. Risk-taking behavior was approximated using average trade size and total daily exposure due to the absence of explicit leverage data.
5. Trading activity and directional bias were compared across Fear and Greed sentiment regimes using statistical summaries and visualizations.


## Key Insights

- Average trade sizes tend to be larger during Greed periods, indicating increased risk appetite.
- Total daily trading exposure is generally higher during Greed compared to Fear.
- Trading activity, measured by the number of trades per day, shows noticeable variation across sentiment regimes.
- Trade size distributions during Greed exhibit higher variability and more extreme outliers, suggesting aggressive behavior by certain traders.


## Strategy Recommendations

- Risk management controls should be tightened during Greed-driven market conditions to mitigate excessive exposure.
- During Fear periods, reduced activity and smaller trade sizes may present opportunities for disciplined, contrarian strategies.
- Monitoring sentiment indicators alongside trading behavior can help identify periods of heightened market risk.
